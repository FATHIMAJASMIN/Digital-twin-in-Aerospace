# ✈️ Digital Twin for Aerospace Manufacturing

**A client-facing prototype to simulate aerospace manufacturing systems with predictive AI — built during my tenure as Team Lead at Advi AI.**

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This Digital Twin project replicates real-time behavior of aerospace manufacturing systems — integrating both AI and physics-based logic to monitor subsystems and predict potential failures.

🛠️ **Key Highlights**:
- Real-time telemetry simulation (e.g., engine heat, vibration, control surfaces)
- Predictive maintenance using machine learning (Scikit-learn/XGBoost)
- Frontend built using **Streamlit** and prototyped in **Figma**
- 3D visualization elements created using **Womp**
- Delivered as a working **demo to an aerospace client**, contributing to cost-saving insights and a successful engagement

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role

- Led a 3-person dev team as **Team Lead** (Embedded Wing)
- Designed the AI and embedded logic pipeline
- Built and delivered the **demo UI** for the client pitch
- Integrated predictive models for maintenance alerts and diagnostics

---

## 🏆 Impact

- ✅ Project successfully secured a client for the company
- 💰 Estimated to reduce operational downtime and maintenance costs by 15–20%
- 💡 Proved cross-domain potential for industrial Digital Twins
